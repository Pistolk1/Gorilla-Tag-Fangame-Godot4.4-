This Project originates from **Miziziziz** and their **Gorilla Tag Godot Movement** project, 
the only changes ive made are orginization as well as edits using **ClaudeAI**(still havent tested if they work)

*sidenote;* markdown it the worst visual text system i will ever force myself to use

**How To Setup?**
in order to setup the project you must download it and delete the android folder(reinstall *android build template...* for exporting to the quest and other headsets)
there is basically no setup for this project and its been setup to be able to export as long as the engine is correctly setup in *editor settings* tutorials can be found online from godot as well as the community :b

**is it okay to use this project for a game?**
i have no clue about legal remifications caused by using this project, i wont go after you because i legally cannot, but Miziziziz might so i would ask them before you start making money or claiming the code as your own(dont do that btw) 
in short it depends on if the original creator Miziziziz is okay with it, im okay with it but its not my code
